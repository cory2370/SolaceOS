The vision of my distro is an ease-of-use focused distro based on Arch/Artix that can be used out of the box, with pre-configured security measures (ClamAV, AppArmor, hardened kernel...)
Oh wait let me make a comparison with 2 distros that inspired me

How is SolaceOS different from Artix?
SolaceOS is beginner's friendly, easy to use and works straight out of the box. Artix is a clean distro so you still kind have to configure the basics like your DE/WM (if installing base), and firewall

How is SolaceOS different from CachyOS?
SolaceOS is EOU and beginner's friendliness focused while CachyOS is speed focused. CachyOS uses systemd and SolaceOS doesn't!!

Next big idea: Use Arch instead of Artix and manually configure OpenRC on it
On a proper note this may not seem viable because my lack of skills on OpenRC and systemd to be configured on Arch
2nd next big idea: Proper documentation
3rd next big idea: Lightweight and speed is our 2nd top priority
